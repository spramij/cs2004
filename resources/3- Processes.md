# Processes
## How it be:
- when it is a live program, called process
- prgram code called text sections
- stack represents temporary data
- heap contains memory dynamically assinged 

## Multiple states
- new: spawned
- running: execution
- waiting: awaiting 
- ready: waiting to run on processor
- terminated: done

## QUeuing algorithms
- short-term scheduler
- long-term schedular
- i/\o bound process


## Process communications
- Named pipes
    - unidirectional, from one to another, no peeking
    - unnamed pipe: fuck yea
