## Classic problems
- Bounded buffer 
- readers & writes
- dinig philosophers

### Bounded Buffer
- n buffer, each holding one item
- producer and consumer

### Reader-Writers 
- data set shared between various processes
- only one writers should write, but many readers can read

### Dining philosophers
- uses semaphores
- how can multiple processes shares a common set of limited resources?

### Transactional memory
- basically, atomic operations on memory

### OpenMP
- let the compiler handle all the things (I think, basically)

### Functional programming languages
- some _wacky_ language that handles vars differently, as immutable

### tbh just read the slides for this chapter, idk its just code lmao <!-- omit in toc -->
