    <h1>Welcome to my CS2004 notes</h1>
    <p> Just a very basic Flsk webapp, to store all my notes for this course that I really don't want to fail.</p>
    <p>The plan is to keep it available on GitHub, to allow other students to have access to it, and to modify and
        improve as needed</p>
    <h2>Let's get this bread</h2>
